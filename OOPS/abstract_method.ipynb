    "For e.g. again take the example of the Vehicle class above. If we want all classes deriving from Vehicle to implement the Drive() method in a fixed way whereas the other methods can be overridden by child classes. In such a scenario we implement the Vehicle class as an abstract class with an implementation of Drive while leave the other methods / properties as abstract so they could be overridden by child classes.\n",

    "–> The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a class library may define an abstract class that is used as a parameter to many of its functions and require programmers using that library to provide their own implementation of the class by creating a derived class.\n",

    "Use an abstract class\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a class library which will be widely distributed or reused—especially to clients, use an abstract class in preference to an interface; because, it simplifies versioning. This is the practice used by the Microsoft team which developed the Base Class Library. ( COM was designed around interfaces.) Use an abstract class to define a common base class for a family of types. Use an abstract class to provide default behavior. Subclass only a base class in a hierarchy to which the class logically belongs."
