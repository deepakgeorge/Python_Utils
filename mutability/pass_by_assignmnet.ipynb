    "Arguments in Python are \"Passed by assignment\". The rationale behind this is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the parameter passed in is actually a reference to an object (but the reference is passed by value)\n",
    "\t* Every time we pass in an object into a function in Python, what we are doing is not passing in a box that contains a object but we are passing in a copy of the box that contains an address to the specific object, i.e. a reference to an object. And when we decide to change that box , if itâ€™s mutable we change the original as well because our box contains an address to that same object. Otherwise if we change the passed in copied box within the function (re-assign) Python does some magic and creates new objects that the box address points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some data types are mutable, but others aren't so:\n",
    "\n",
    "       * If you pass a mutable object into a method, the method gets a reference to that same object and you can mutate it to your heart's delight, but if you rebind the reference in the method, the outer scope will know nothing about it, and after you're done, the outer reference will still point at the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "       * If you pass an immutable object to a method, you still can't rebind the outer reference, and you can't even mutate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it even more clear, let's have some examples."
